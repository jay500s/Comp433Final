# TapJack

## Project Description

This project is an application that seeks to mimic a popular card game known as "Slap Jack." It uses the Google Play Services to host a real-time interface and provide multi-player functionality.

## Installation

Installation is fairly straightforward with a few points to pay attention to.

1. Make sure to use your debug.keystore in order to generate the correct signed APK from Android Studio (Tools -> Generate Signed APK).
2. Since this app is in its "testing phase," only those players who have been registered by the administrator can access the functionality.
3. Assuming you are a registered user, you must have a Google Play account to sign-in and access the game's functionality.  

Besides these pointers, installation is as simple as running the app on your phone thorugh Android Studio (Run -> Run app).
